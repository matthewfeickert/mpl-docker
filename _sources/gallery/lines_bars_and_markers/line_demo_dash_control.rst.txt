==============================
Customizing dashed line styles
==============================

The dashing of a line is controlled via a dash sequence. It can be modified
using `.Line2D.set_dashes`.

The dash sequence is a series of on/off lengths in points, e.g.
``[3, 1]`` would be 3pt long lines separated by 1pt spaces.

Some functions like `.Axes.plot` support passing Line properties as keyword
arguments. In such a case, you can already set the dashing when creating the
line.

*Note*: The dash style can also be configured via a
:doc:`property_cycle </tutorials/intermediate/color_cycle>`
by passing a list of dash sequences using the keyword *dashes* to the
cycler. This is not shown within this example.
